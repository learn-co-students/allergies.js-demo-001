# Allergies

## Background

An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).

The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

* eggs (1)
* peanuts (2)
* shellfish (4)
* strawberries (8)
* tomatoes (16)
* chocolate (32)
* pollen (64)
* cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:

- Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.
- All the allergens Tom is allergic to.

## Tests

Review the `allergies.js` file inside the `lib` directory, and then the `allergies.spec.js` file inside the `spec` directory. Review each of the tests, and then start implementing your solutions to make each test pass in `allergies.js`.
